        <h2 class="topic block">Purpose</h2>
        <p>This website will serve as a personal website where I can store examples of previous work experience and
           to describe myself. This may include blog entries or examples of things I've done in class using different coding
           languages and/or technologies, as well as presentations or other documents to share my skills.</p>
        <h2 class="topic block">Audience</h2>
        <p>This will be primarily for future employers. This will provide an explorable repository of my work and interests
           to improve the <span>visibility of my skillset</span>. This way, people who may be considering working with me have a tangible
           representation of my work.</p>
